# A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment

## abstract
contribution: 站在 llm 的 lifechain 的角度全面系统性地总结了 llm 的 safety issues，rather than focus on specific stages like deployment or fine-tuning phases

LLM lifecycle: data preparation, pre-training, post-training (including alignment and fine-tuning, model editing, etc.), deployment and final commercialization.

promising research directions: safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems.
